# Algorithm used to shorten URL

    In order to generate the shortest possible length relative to the number of
    links currently in the database, I used the `id` column that is an auto-
    incremented integer, converted that integer to a string which is a
    combination of `CHARACTERS` array elements. Because this array contains 62
    characters, it basically comes down to converting `id` integer into base-62
    "number".
